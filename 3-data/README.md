## Exercise 3.1 - Address Book

Write a simple address book program, that allows to
* add, delete entries
* search by name (substring)

Make sure your address book is implemented in a separate package and make most things are not visible outside the package (only interfaces + constructor function).


Hint: Use a simple map as storage

### Variant 1:
Create another package "importer" that provides functionality to import entries (e.g. generate random ones) into an addressbook.

### Variant 2:

### Variant 3 (if you are bored):
Implement an importer that imports a (predefined) list of github users.

Hint: see addressbook-github.go
